        <p>
          The first person to make me aware of Håkan Hardenberger was my
          brother. This must have been around 1985 since he was making military
          service that year as a musician. Håkan was also among the first in the
          80’s to do military service as a wind band soldier. I remember being
          very admiring about hearing him play. It was fantastic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not long after that I heard Håkans first recording in his own name,
          ”The Virtuoso trumpet”. Especially the playing in Jean Françaix
          Sonatina and the Variations on a Theme from Norma had big impact on
          me. Such smooth, precise and musically playing. I was astounded and
          very happy to hear such fine trumpet playing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have followed Håkan since and visited a couple of concerts. Always
          happy to hear this wonderful music flowing out from him and his
          trumpet. Very inspirational for me
